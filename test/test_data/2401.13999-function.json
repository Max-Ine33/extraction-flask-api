    "summary": "We explicitly determine the optimal degenerations of Fano threefolds $X$ in\nfamily No 2.23 of Mori-Mukai's list as predicted by the Hamilton-Tian\nconjecture. More precisely, we find a special degeneration $(\\mathcal{X},\n\\xi_0)$ of $X$ such that $(\\mathcal{X}_0, \\xi_0)$ is weighted K-polystable,\nwhich is equivalent to $(\\mathcal{X}_0, \\xi_0)$ admitting a K\\\"ahler-Ricci\nsoliton (KRS) by \\cite{HL23} and \\cite{BLXZ23}. Furthermore, we study the\nmoduli spaces of $(\\mathcal{X}_0, \\xi_0)$. The $\\mathbf{H}$-invariant of $X$\ndivides the natural parameter space into two strata, which leads to different\nmoduli spaces of KRS Fano varieties. We show that one of them is isomorphic to\nthe GIT-moduli space of biconic curves $C\\subseteq \\mathbb{P}^1\\times\n\\mathbb{P}^1$, and the other one is a single point.",
